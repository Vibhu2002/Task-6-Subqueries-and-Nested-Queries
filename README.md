# Task 6 - Subqueries and Nested Queries

## Objective
Demonstrate the use of subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses using MySQL/SQLite.

## Contents
- **Dataset:** `departments` and `employees` tables.
- **Queries:**
  - Scalar subquery in SELECT
  - Subquery in WHERE (IN)
  - Subquery in WHERE (EXISTS)
  - Correlated subquery
  - Derived table (subquery in FROM)

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Create the tables and insert the sample data.
3. Run each query to see the results.

## Key Concepts
- **Scalar Subquery:** Returns one value.
- **Correlated Subquery:** Refers to columns from the outer query.
- **IN / EXISTS:** Filters data using subqueries.
- **Derived Table:** Treats subquery results as a table.
